            "You enter a state of extreme focus in battle.\n\nOn your turn, you can enter a trance as a bonus action.\nWhile in trance, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:\n- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\n- When you make a weapon attack, you may add your Proficiency bonus to the damage roll.\n- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n- Your Superiority Dice increase by one die size.\n- If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while in trance\n\nYour trance lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your trance on your turn as a bonus action.\n\nOnce you have entered trance the maximum number of times for your Barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can trance again. You may enter trance 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th."
